# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
Analyzing the sentiments from tweets


This histogram visualizes the frequency of likes received by tweets in the dataset. The x-axis represents the number of likes, while the y-axis shows the frequency of tweets that fall within each bin. The kernel density estimate (KDE) overlay provides a smooth representation of the distribution, helping to identify trends such as skewness or peaks in the data.

Similar to the likes distribution, this histogram illustrates the frequency of shares for the tweets. The x-axis indicates the number of shares, and the y-axis represents the frequency of tweets. The KDE overlay helps to visualize the overall distribution shape, revealing insights into how often tweets are shared.

The confusion matrix visualizes the performance of the sentiment classification model. The matrix displays the actual versus predicted sentiment classifications, with true labels on the y-axis and predicted labels on the x-axis. Each cell shows the count of predictions for each category, allowing for easy identification of misclassifications. This matrix is crucial for understanding the model's accuracy and areas for improvement.

These visualizations collectively provide insights into the engagement metrics of tweets (likes and shares) and the sentiment analysis results, helping to understand the overall sentiment distribution and the effectiveness of the classification model.
